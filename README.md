# Malaria
Quick microsite for an application to SocialCops - I was given the open brief of presenting data regarding Malaria in recognition of World Malaria Day.

I took the same data and graphics and produced:
1. This microsite
2. An infographic - which you can see [here](https://tinyworld.xyz/work/projects/application-to-sc)
3. A Printable PDF - which you can also see [here](https://tinyworld.xyz/work/projects/application-to-sc) (same 'here' as the other 'here')
4. A simple email to promote the inforgraphics 'n stuff - which you can't find anywhere, I've lost it.
